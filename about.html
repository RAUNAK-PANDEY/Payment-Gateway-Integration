        Greetings of the day!
        <br>
        <br> 
        When it comes to Natural Calamities, it has mostly left a scarring impact on the lives of thousands of people who either end up losing their lives, or have lifelong injuries, or become homeless, or become unemployed along with a sack of burden carrying financial losses. It may or may not be our dear ones, but at the end of the day, we all are one. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Someone wise had once said, “While natural disasters capture headlines and national attention short-term, the work of recovery and rebuilding is long-term.” As you are aware of the flood that took place in India, there have been several lives that have suffered an unimaginable loss.
        <br>
        <br>
        We at Flood Relief Camp have decided to donate money to the flood-affected people We would remain grateful to you if you could show some support to help these flood-affected victims make their both ends meet. Any amount of contribution from your behalf is appreciated.
